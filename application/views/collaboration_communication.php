                Digital transformation is rapidly changing how and from where we
                conduct business, resulting in huge market growth for collaborative
                solutions and video conferencing technologies. To service this
                demand a multitude of vendors have entered the market which has
                created complexity for the Enterprise. As working culture evolves
                and modernises, users require the tools and support to collaborate
                with colleagues, customers, suppliers and partners â€“ from any
                location, from any device, and using the meeting solution of their
                choice, seamlessly.
